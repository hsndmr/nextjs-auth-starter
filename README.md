## Nextjs Auth Starter
The NextJS Auth Starter project uses [a NestJS api](https://github.com/hsndmr/nestjs-auth-starter) for user authentication and has three pages: login, register, and dashboard. Visitors to the site can either log in or register, while users can log out. The project utilizes XState for handling authentication-related cases.
